Join best-selling author Caroline Myss in a full weekend experience as we explore the following:</p>\n<ol class=\"ak-ol\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Requirements for Health and Healing Today </strong>&ndash; Our inner needs &mdash; the deep frontier of consciousness that has led us to discoveries about who we are, what we want, what we need, what we believe, how we think, and what gives our lives meaning and purpose &mdash; influence the dynamics of our health and what we require to heal. Our interior self, our inner narratives, our personal beliefs are as integral to our health as our lifestyle habits. The new challenge? Integrating the soul.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What Is God? </strong>&ndash; Spirituality has become a choice, even a hobby. Crises of faith, trust, and hope are in epidemic proportions in our lives, from loss of faith in other people to the inability to have faith in oneself. We confuse our issues with traditional religion with our intrinsic need for personal contact with the Divine. They&rsquo;re connected to an inability &ndash; or a deliberate choice &ndash; to explore faith in something greater than yourself as a source of inner guidance. So, what is God for you, and does a connection with the Divine matter?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Crisis of the Soul or Clinical Depression? </strong>&ndash; We are people of the psyche and soul. A spiritual crisis can present exactly like a psychological crisis. Both a psychological and spiritual crisis trigger depression and often great anxiety, activating deep states of despair. We actively pursue cosmic-sized questions, such as, &ldquo;What is the purpose of my life?&rdquo; but those are not questions. They are prayers, answered through journeys of inner transformation. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bio Ecological Spirituality</strong> &ndash; Traditional religions are reaching their end game as we prepare to enter a galactic community. The time has come for a new spiritual template and language of God, one that reflects the power of the soul and the nature of the Divine as reflected in the natural order of the universe. Our spirituality must transition beyond an Earth-centric God to be inclusive of a sacred universe of life. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spiritual Direction for a Modern Person</strong> &ndash; You may not need a religion, but every person needs a way to examine the voice of the soul. The truth is, you have unfinished business with yourself. Resolution is only achieved by examination of conscience and sifting through inner debris to find the shards of wisdom that you earned through difficult experiences. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Speaking a Holy Language </strong>&ndash; There comes a point in our lives when we are called to pray ― when we see that our rational minds cannot make sense of the mystery of life and we realize we need another way. Humility allows us to bypass the ego and connect directly to the Divine. Sacrificing the familiar and entering the unknown puts you on the path of grace so you can act from a place of love. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Becoming a Holy Troublemaker </strong>&ndash; What does all this knowledge mean for you today? How much are you ready for your life to change? And are you willing to participate as an agent of change in the world today? The Divine is always drafting people into the role of holy troublemakers &ndash; an archetype that works in the service of transformation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
