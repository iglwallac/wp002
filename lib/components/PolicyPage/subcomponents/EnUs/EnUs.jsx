          You will be required to provide your credit card number and other
          information at the time of your initial registration. Your credit
          card will automatically be charged at the time of your subscription
          or the end of your free trial, and regularly thereafter based on the
          terms of your subscription, and you hereby authorize Gaia to charge
          your credit card for the then-applicable subscription fee. The Fee
          is non-refundable except as provided in Section 26 below (“Term and
          Termination”). Gaia reserves the right to change or modify the Fee
          or payment schedule (including, without limitation, increasing
          prices and charging a fee for upgrades) at any time. Plans priced in
          currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to adjustment due to
          fluctuations in exchange rates. Gaia will use its reasonable best
          efforts to provide you with reasonable notice prior to making any
          fee changes or modifications, with the exception of exchange rate
          changes.

          If Gaia is for any reason unable to effect automatic payment via
          your credit card, Gaia will attempt to notify you via email and your
          account will be disabled until payment is received. You are
          responsible for notifying Gaia of any changes to your credit card
          information and to update your information if your credit card has
          expired. Gaia may suspend, terminate and/or otherwise interrupt your
          access to the Services if you fail to so notify Gaia.

          which taxes you are required to pay except for taxes based on Gaia’s
          net income. You are responsible for obtaining and providing to Gaia
          any certificate of exemption or similar document required to exempt
          any transaction from sales, use or similar tax liability.

          remaining balances due from you. This paragraph will in no way limit
          any other remedies available to Gaia. You are required to notify us
          of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days
          after they first appear on your credit card account statement by
          sending a written notice to info@gaia.com. If you do not so notify
          us within the time allowed, you waive any right to dispute such

          <strong>12a. Content.</strong> The content available at the Websites

        <p className="policy__content">
          <strong>12b. Geographic Limitations.</strong> Due to certain
          licensing restrictions placed on our titles, some content may not be
          available in your geographic location, and therefore, cannot be
          viewed. If at any time you feel this inhibits your experience upon
          purchasing a Gaia subscription, please contact our customer service
          department and we will work with you in order to remedy the
          situation. You can reach customer service by email at info@gaia.com.

          <strong>13. Ownership of Content.</strong> Gaia does not claim
          ownership rights in any User Content that you post on the Websites
          or otherwise make available through the Services. Subject to the
          non-exclusive license contained in Section 14 below (“License to
          Your Content”), as between Gaia and you, you will retain all
          intellectual property rights that you may have in any User Content

          Agreement, you are required to grant a license to Gaia to use and
          distribute your User Content. This enables us to permit other
          Visitors and Registered Users to view and share your User Content,
          and to display your User Content in other places within the

          collectively, <strong>"posting"</strong>) any User Content on or
          through our Websites or the Services, you hereby grant to Gaia a

          Services and/or the advertising, publicity, promotional and
          marketing materials for the Websites and the Services in any and all
          formats and media now known or hereafter invented. If you wish to
          remove any User Content from the Websites and/or the Services, the
          decision will be made by Gaia alone in its sole and absolute
          discretion, and our decision may depend on the type of User Content,
          the location and manner of posting, and other factors. You may
          contact us at info@gaia.com to request the removal of certain User
          Content you have posted, but Gaia (i)has no obligation to remove any
          such User Content, (ii)may choose whether or not to do so in its
          sole discretion, and (iii)makes no guarantee as to the complete

          removed from the Websites and/or the Services, and Gaia retains all
          rights granted in this section to all such remaining copies. You
          represent and warrant that: (i) you own all right, title and
          interest in all User Content posted by you on or through our
          Websites or the Services, or otherwise have the right to grant the
          license set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your User
          Content on or through the Websites and/or the Services does not
          require the knowledge or consent of any third party and does not
          violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights,
